# Introduction 
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a IT & Telecoms industry dataset using SQL. The primary objective was to derive actionable insights from customer demographics, service usage patterns, and financial performance data. This analysis aims to help stakeholders make informed decisions, improve customer retention, optimise service offerings, and enhance overall business performance.

# Background
The IT & Telecoms industry is a critical sector that provides essential services such as internet, mobile communication, and data services. With the rapid growth in technology and increasing demand for connectivity, analysing industry data becomes crucial. This project focuses on understanding customer behaviour, service utilisation, and financial metrics through a structured database comprising customer, service, subscription, usage, and payment information.

# Tools I Used
- SQL: Used for querying and analysing data stored in relational databases.
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): Used to create and manage the database.
- Data Visualisation Tools: Power BI.

# The Analysis
The analysis was performed using various SQL queries, addressing different aspects of the data:

Customer Demographics Analysis:
- Identified the number of customers by country.
- Calculated the average age of customers.

Service Usage Analysis:
- Summarised total data used and minutes used per service type.

Financial Performance:
- Calculated total revenue generated by each service type.
- Analysed monthly revenue trends to identify patterns.

Churn Analysis:
- Counted the number of subscriptions that ended each month to understand churn rates.

Customer Segmentation:
- Segmented customers based on the services they use, providing insights into customer preferences.

# What I Learned 
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:

- SQL Proficiency: Improved my skills in writing complex SQL queries, joining tables, and performing aggregations.
- Data Analysis: Learned how to derive meaningful insights from raw data and identify trends and patterns.
- Business Insights: Understood the key metrics and performance indicators relevant to the IT & Telecoms industry.
- Customer Behaviour: Gained insights into customer demographics and usage patterns, helping to identify target segments and service preferences.
- Data Visualisation: Enhanced my ability to present data visually, making it easier to communicate findings to stakeholders.

# Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the IT & Telecoms industry, highlighting several key findings:

- Customer Distribution: The number of customers varies significantly by country, indicating potential markets for expansion or targeted marketing.
- Service Usage: Different service types show varied usage patterns, helping to identify popular services and opportunities for bundling or promotions.
- Revenue Trends: Monthly revenue trends revealed seasonality and growth patterns, aiding in financial planning and forecasting.
- Churn Rates: Understanding churn rates helped identify periods of high customer attrition, suggesting the need for improved customer retention strategies.
- Customer Segmentation: Segmenting customers based on service usage provided a clearer picture of customer preferences, supporting personalised marketing efforts.

Overall, the project demonstrated the power of SQL in analysing industry data and provided a solid foundation for making data-driven decisions in the IT & Telecoms sector.
